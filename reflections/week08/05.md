# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
i got a good group!!! good comunicatoin, interesting project, work well together. we do have one person (who shal reamin nameless) who has made things rather difficult for some specific things, but it good to be able to probelm solve with someone who you may not understand or jive with. over all i think veryone in my group has handled that bumb in the road well. 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
postman! i  mean we have been using it for a long time, but the more i use it, and learn how it works. the bettter im getting with it. 
- What are you struggling with?
getting on a roll in the backend, and then realizing that we need to write things differently, and how complkicated that can be when you have already finsished so much to go pack and change it without breaking it. 
- What would you count as a victory?
gettting a really good portfoliio piece out of this capstone project!!
