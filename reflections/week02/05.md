# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
to be honest i didnt feel like much went well this week until i got my tudor session. for most of the week i felt pretty lost, but it was nice to have an ah ha moment towards the end of the week. 

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

working as a team went really well. I have always thought that I work well in a team, but week one i thought that maybe 'group projects' werent going to be my thing. but this week brought me more confidence, and i think my team worked well together. 

- What are you struggling with?
templates. i can do them, i just dont toally get them 100%
i would like to get more familiar with for each and for in loops. Again i know how to do them, but i feel way more comftorable with for loops, and i would like to get to be that comftorable with the other loops. 

- What would you count as a victory?
passing.
