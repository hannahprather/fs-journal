## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
probably the user experience, we didnt get to all of the things we wanted to.. but design was important on this checkpoint then on others. 
2. What went well this week?
tam and my partnership went really well. she and i work well together, and i thought we were really respectful to one another. we were also really encouraging to one another. 

3. What would you do differently?

honestly.... not much. 
except i cried infront of jake and zach because i was so happy that something finally worked..... so yeah... probably that.
