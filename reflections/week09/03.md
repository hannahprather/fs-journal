## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

 Base64 is an encoding schema used for representing binary data in a text format

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

the browser is unable to store the images locally so it will always need to fetch them from your server.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

back in the day there were limitations with how many times you could fetch data from the service. so base64 allowed us to be able to get around that.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

front end is cranking. we are getting by well AND we are all getting along. we do have some competing personalitites and differnt ideas of how to do things but i think we are all compromising and working well together. i think we might even like each other after this is over! 
ive also learned a lot from tam and jake today about how i have been writing some parts of my code, they showed me how to shorten it and clean it up.
