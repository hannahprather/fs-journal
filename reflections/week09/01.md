## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
figma, bootstrap, vue, postman, and lucid chart
2. What went well so far?
so far we have been doing well and everyone is working well together. we have had many stand ups through out the day and are keeping to schedule. 

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I wish we would have done a little more planning in the beginning that way we wouldnt have to make so many decisions as we go.
