## Questions

it clarifyies your website, keeping it easy for the user.

low-fidelity
 get things onto a page, rough outline. visual representation of the page.

mid-fidelity
a little bit more accurate representaton of your site. Adding more detail to your frame. ex. 'placeholder photos' font weights, margings.

high-fidelity
the most defined of the three. this is where you would use figma. This is when you get a visual representation of almost exactly what you want to see on the page. 


3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
YES. So far it has helped me 
 - visualise my site and get the basics framed out before I fill in my content. 
 - helps get what you want visually down before coding it out, so you dint have to design whilw coding. 
 - if you are working for a client, you can get their feedback before coding it out.
