## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use 

a pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. You would use it if you needed to have something chang3e color while you are holding the mouse over it.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
specificity is the 'hierarchy' of the styles. Specificity is the priority in which css will apply your style. It can help in many ways, if you need a style to be selected then you could use an identifier to insure it will work (because it has the highest priority), if you need to prioritise it over a previously applied style.


3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
if you over use it than you can have two equally important competing styles that wouldnt work. you want to keep your specificity as low as possible, so you can build up so you wont have two diferent styles with the same importance.
