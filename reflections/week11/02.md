## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

primary key is the main id of that table. foreign key are when you access properties on one different table.

2. What is an `Alias`?

alias is when we shorten words and define them later so we dont have to type as much. 

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
  
)

SELECT * FROM doctors pnd
INNER JOIN patients p ON p.id = pnd.doctorsId
INNER JOIN doctors d ON c.id = pnd.doctorsId;
