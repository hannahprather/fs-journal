# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I made it this far! the repetition that we did this week going over c# brought me leeps and bounds pasy last week. 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
How many people prefer c# over node... I feel liek everyone is so comftorable c# already and that it makes more sense than node. For me we had so much time and practice with node that it was surprised eveyone took to c# so well.
- What are you struggling with?
confidence, anxiety, and c# 

however after getting the final i do feel like i can do this. im glad we have tests to help guide us. (i say that now anyways)
but we got a lot of good references this week, so i can do this. 
- What would you count as a victory?
passing! i just want to pass this class.
