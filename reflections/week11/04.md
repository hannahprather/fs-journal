## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.


Im so NERVOUS! but the closer we get to it the more comftorable/confident im becoming. Looking back, the first lecture that we had was so accurate, you really have no idea how much you dont know, and I feel that now more than ever. Imposters syndrome 10000000%, but when i look back at what I knew 3 months ago vs what I know now, I feel like I have acomplished so much. The past three moths have felt like drinking from a fire hose, im just hoping to make it through this final, and pass!!!
This course has also brought me so many new friends that i will have long after this class is over. Im starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and the whole goal of this course for me(when i signed up) was to get out of bartending and managing bars, not only is that closer to becoming my reality, I found interest in things i didnt even know existed. Next up... pass the final.

## Afternoon Assignment Link

**[Repo](https://github.com/hannahprather/<ASSIGNMENT_REPO>)** We built an assignment in class so we didnt have a repo.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
tomorrow is the final. im trying not to allow myself to get to anxious. C# and mySQL arent my biggest strengths, but after today, and having all the references that we have, i think i can do this.
