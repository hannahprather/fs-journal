## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type - integer-based and floating-point based
Reference type - holds the reference of memory address instead of value
Pointer type - variable that holds memory address of another types

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

 bool byte char decimal double enum float int long sbyte short struct uint ulong ushort
there are some similarities and some differences. there is much more difining in c#

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
a reference type doesnâ€™t store its value directly, and it contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data. where the value type holds a data value within its own memory space.
