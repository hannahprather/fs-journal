# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
monday and thats about it
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
honestly im not sure i did. I think this week has made my head hurt and im trying so hard but im really not getting some of this. In the past by thursday i feel like i am starting to get a grasp of things and that was NOT the case this week. 
- What are you struggling with?
honestly, i know i learned things this week, but i dont feel like i did. while doing this checkpoint ive had more challenges than noremal. i feel like my brain wont let anything stick. I remember the "imposter syndrome bell curve thing" (technical term) we were shown on day one and i 100% am feeling that.

- What would you count as a victory?
passing
